-- this file documents presets for level data
-- level data has the following format:
-- {
  -- the initial speed upon match start, defines how many frameConstantss it takes to rise one row via the SPEED_TO_RISE_TIME table
--   startingSpeed = 1,
  -- the mechanism through which speed increases throughout the game
  -- mode 1: in constant time intervals
  -- mode 2: depending on how many panels were cleared according to the PANELS_TO_NEXT_SPEED table
--   speedIncreaseMode = 1,
  -- how many blocks need to be cleared to queue the next shock panel for panel generation
--   shockFrequency = 12,
  -- how many shock panels can be queued at maximum; set to 0 to disable shock blocks
--   shockCap = 21,
  -- how many colors are used for panel generation
--   colors = 5,
  -- unconditional invincibility frameConstantss that run out while topped out with no other type of invincibility frameConstantss available
  -- may refill once no longer topped out
--   maxHealth = 121,
  -- the stop table contains constants for calculating the awarded stop time from chains and combos
--   stop = {
    -- the formula used for calculating stop time
--     formula = 1,
    -- formula 1 & 2: unconditional constant awarded for any combo while not topped out
--     comboConstant = -20,
    -- formula 1: unconditional constant awarded for any chain while not topped and any combo while topped out
    -- formula 2: unconditional constant awarded for any chain while not topped out
--     chainConstant = 80,
    -- formula 1: unconditional constant awarded for any chain while topped out
    -- formula 2: unconditional costant awarded for any combo or chain while topped out
--     dangerConstant = 160,
    -- formula 1: additional stoptime is provided upon meeting certain thresholds for chain length / combo size, both regular and topped out
    -- formula 2: does not use coefficients
--     coefficient = 20,
--   },
  -- the frameConstants table contains information relevant for panels physics
--   frameConstants = {
    -- for how long a panel stays above an empty space before falling down
--     HOVER = 12,
    -- for how long garbage panels are in hover state after popping
--     GARBAGE_HOVER = 41,
    -- for how long panels flash after being matched
--     FLASH = 44,
    -- for how long panels show their matched face after completing the flash (before the pop timers of the panels start)
    -- this may not be directly referenced in favor of a MATCH constant that equals FLASH + FACE (the total time a panel stays in matched state)
--     FACE = 20,
    -- how long it takes for 1 panel of a match to pop (go from popping to popped)
--     POP = 9
