Notation
========

This file details the copyright status of its asset files and if available the related license the artwork has been made available to use under.  
Individual contributions may be subsumed under the title "The Panel Attack Contributors" if a creator does not wish for their name to be listed. This does not affect the rights of the creator nor transfers any rights to other Panel Attack contributors.
For brevity, all file paths are to be assumed to be located within the client/assets/ directory.
For brevity, directories may be addressed directly if the copyright and license status can be summarized for all of its contents. If a file is addressed by more than one entry, the most specific one applies. Copyright and license notice do not apply for non-artworks in directories addressed as such (e.g. configuration files, code).
For brevity, multiple entries may be made in succession to indicate the same creator and license status.
For brevity, notation may use common wildcards to indicate ownership and license for similarly named groups of files.
For brevity, some keywords are used that encompass groups of file that form a cohesive whole when put together in the game.
For brevity, names used in this file may address files by name only, meaning without both file extension (e.g. ".png") and scale indicator (e.g. "@2x")
Panel Attack attempts to use metadata in all of its assets under version control to indicate copyright status beyond this textual representation.
If metadata information of an asset version controlled in this repository contradicts this document, please assume a mistake has happened, open an issue and err on the side of caution regarding use.
If an asset is not tracked by this file and has no metadata information, similarly assume that all rights are reserved. In some cases a file may not be tracked because its content is not considered copyrightable by nature e.g. themes/Panel Attack Modern/transparent.png

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
  Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
  PREAMBLE

  The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
  development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
  efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
  open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
  with others.

  The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
  redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
  fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
  redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
  names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
  however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
  requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
  to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
  DEFINITIONS

  "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
  Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
  include source files, build scripts and documentation.

  "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
  copyright statement(s).

  "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
  distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

  "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
  or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
  Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
  new environment.

  "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
  writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
  PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
  a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
  redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
  Software, subject to the following conditions:

  1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
  in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

  2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
  redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
  contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
  included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
  in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
  binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

  3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
  Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
  Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
  presented to the users.

  4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
  Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
  Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
  Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
  permission.

  5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
  must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
  distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
  remain under this license does not apply to any document created
  using the Font Software.
  TERMINATION

  This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
  not met.
  DISCLAIMER

  THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
  OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
  FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
  OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

  These have been licensed for embedding in Panel Attack releases according to the EULA from the Unity Asset Store and a license has been purchased via this URL:
  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/interface-and-item-sounds-89646
  You cannot use them for any other purpose than embedding in Panel Attack.

  Additionally the situation on these is a bit unclear. The EULA suggests that it might be required for each developer to acquire their own license to work with the assets.
  However, the licensor of the assets, Cafofo Music, went completely missing and many of their asset packs have been taken down, presumably for copyright infringement.
  Unlike most other asset packs from this seller however, according to our insight this pack is still available for download for the anyone who originally purchased it. This indicates that it was not flagged for copyright and the mediator (Unity) considers these assets as lawfully acquired as otherwise continuing to host them would be an infringement itself.
  The conclusion is that we cannot obtain new licenses by fault of the licensor but the already acquired license is valid.
  Accordingly these assets should be replaced as soon as convenient or once the licensor becomes available again, maintainers shall obtain additional licenses, whichever is first.
